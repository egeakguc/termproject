# Predictive Analysis of Customer Lifetime Value

## Abstract

This project conducts a comprehensive predictive analysis of Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) across various countries using machine learning techniques. By leveraging a dataset encompassing user engagement and revenue metrics, we employ Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models to forecast CLTV, providing insights into customer behavior and revenue generation patterns.

## Introduction

The objective of this study is to understand and predict the Lifetime Value of customers from different countries based on their engagement and transaction history. Accurate prediction of CLTV enables businesses to tailor their marketing strategies effectively, optimizing resource allocation and maximizing profitability.

## Data Description

The dataset, `data.csv`, includes user engagement metrics, transaction history, and revenue data across multiple countries. It forms the basis for our analysis, enabling the identification of key factors influencing revenue and customer lifetime value.

## Methodology

My analysis begins with exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's characteristics, followed by the development of predictive models:
- **Linear Regression**: Serves as the baseline for comparison.
- **Random Forest**: Utilized for its ability to handle non-linear data and provide insights into feature importance.
- **Gradient Boosting**: Applied for its advanced optimization capabilities, further refining the accuracy of our predictions.

## Results

The models reveal significant insights into the factors driving customer value, with Gradient Boosting demonstrating superior performance in predicting CLTV. Detailed findings and model comparisons are presented in the `Report.pdf`, showcasing the potential of machine learning in strategic decision-making processes.
